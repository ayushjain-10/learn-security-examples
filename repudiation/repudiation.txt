- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.
- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Additional security mechanisms that could be incorporated:
1. Digital signatures for messages to verify authenticity
2. Secure, tamper-evident logging mechanisms (e.g., blockchain-based audit logs)
3. Implementation of real user authentication and authorization (not just placeholders)
4. Session management with unique session IDs
5. More detailed user activity logging including browser information and device fingerprinting
